Chocolat is a programming text editor for OS X. It seems to have been abandoned by its original developers some time in 2017; however, I'm the guy who is running OS X Mavericks perminantly, so I don't care if it's still getting updated. CodeRunner simply doesn't work well enough, I _need_ to find a new code editor! 

I like Chocolat a lot, except for one or two things... okay, maybe ten things... and the fact that certain actions make it crash... oh god, I'm going to have to fix it, aren't I? Why can't I ever just find an app I like and use it like a normal person? Sigh...

All code in this repository is split into one file per feature/change. A comment at the top of each file explains what it does.

A significant amount of code was written by Claude. I had great success with giving Claude access to output from Hopper; Claude is _very_ good at reading assembly, and it was able to answer detailed questions about Chocolat's internals, sometimes almost as if it had the source code. I included my claude.md file in the repository. Note that the files it references are _not_ included in this repository, you'll need to generate these yourself using Hopper and class-dump.

All code in this repository is released into the public domain and/or licensed under Creative Commons 0. The actual Chocolat app is of course copyright its original developers, Alex Gordon and Jean-Nicolas Jolivetâ€”thank you so much to them for making this wonderful app!
