Overview
========
This project modifies the behavior of the closed-source Chocolat app. The main directory includes one .m file for each feature added/modified.

The Chocolat app bundle itself is at /Applications/Chocolat.app.



Chocolat App Information
========================
This directory contains information extracted from reverse engineering tools which you should use.

Headers
-------
All of Chocolat's objective-c methods organized by class. Refer to "Chocolat.asm" and/or "Chocolat Pseduo Code.m" to see the implementation. Method names can be misleading; double check the implementation to confirm a method does what you expect.

Chocolat.asm
------------
Assembly for all procedures, generated by Hopper. This is the most useful resource!

Chocolat Pseduo Code.m
------------------------
Psuedo-code for all procedures, generated by Hopper. May be inaccurate and/or incomplete. Refer to Chocolat.asm as the authoritative source.


Target Operating System
=======================
This project targets Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks. The code will never run on a newer operating system. Our development system also runs Mavericks.

Testing Changes
===============
Run `make install` when changes are ready to test.

Coding Style
============
### Less code is better than more code.

### Only add error checking if the error path will be hit in practice.
For example:

```
if ([[goMenu itemArray] count] >= 2) {
    [goMenu removeItemAtIndex:[[goMenu itemArray] count] - 2];
}
```

We know beyond a doubt that Chocolat's Go menu will have more than two items. This code should be:

```
[goMenu removeItemAtIndex:[[goMenu itemArray] count] - 2];
```
If you're not sure, test. This is very important.

### Use ZKSwizzle to hook methods unless there is a compelling reason not to.
